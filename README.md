# Employee Statistics

This repo was created to get a better understanding of Sequelize.

### Inspiration
I want to store statistics about employees (department, nationality, etc.. ) and create assigned roles (retrospective organiser, sentry ninja, etc..).

### Details
A REST interface with two entities; Employee and Role. An ER Diagram can be found [here](https://www.lucidchart.com/invitations/accept/e63e1f4b-953c-46fd-ad96-2c89a43110c6).

The postgres DB is hosted on ElephantSQL for development/production and runs locally for tests.
