# Employee Statistics

This repo was created to get a better understanding of using Sequelize and some basic CRUD operations.

### Inspiration
I wanted to be able to store statistics about employees (department, nationality, etc.. ) and create assigned roles (retrospective organiser, sentry ninja, etc..).

### Details
We have a basic REST interface with two entities; Employee and Role. The ER Diagram for this can be found [here](https://www.lucidchart.com/invitations/accept/e63e1f4b-953c-46fd-ad96-2c89a43110c6).

The postgres DB is hosted on ElephantSQL and also locally for tests. The server will be hosted on heroku eventually.
